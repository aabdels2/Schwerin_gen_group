1) A man was walking on the street, and a hund chased him
2) The hund chased him all over berlin and to the Flughafen
3) The man arrived at the flughafen in Raesfeld and was able to get away from the hund by distracting it with some bratwurst he bought.
4) The man was so happy to get away from the hund, but he was so hot, so he sat under the Klimaanlage.
5) He started whistling Rammstein's Engel when he saw one in dirndel nonchalantly carrying 12 mugs of beer.
6) He recognized the woman wearing the dirndel to be a famous descendant of the Eltz family.
7) Realizing that a cold beer might be better than the klimaanlage, he walked over to her biergarten.
8) Seeing that the biergarten was over 10km away, he decided to rent a Porsche.
9) He drove his newly rented Porsche down the hauptstrasse to the woman's biergarten, thinking he might get some doener to go with with his beer.
